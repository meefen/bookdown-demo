                   frequently appear as subsets of a set of objects. Over the

                   To address this issue, we propose a model-based approach
                   called the Hub Model which assumes that every observed group

                   other members of the group. The performance of Hub Models is

  abstract  = "The Third Edition of this best-selling text has been fully
               revised and updated to include coverage of the many developments
               on social network analysis (SNA) over the last decade. Written
               in a clear and accessible style, the book introduces these
               topics to newcomers and non-specialists and gives sufficient
               detail for more advanced users of social network analysis.
               Throughout the book, key ideas are discussed in relation to the
               principal software programs available for SNA. The book provides
               a comprehensive overview of the field, outlining both its
               theoretical basis and its key techniques. Drawing from the core
               ideas of points, lines and paths, John Scott builds a framework
               of network analysis that covers such measures as density,
               centrality, clustering, centralisation, and spatialisation. He
               identifies the various types of clique, component, and circle
               into which networks are formed, and he outlines an approach to
               socially structured positions within networks. A completely new
               chapter in this edition discusses recent work on network
               dynamics and methods for studying change over time. A final
               chapter discusses approaches to network visualisation. This is
               an excellent resource for researchers across the social sciences
               and for students of social theory and research methods.",

  abstract = "In 2009 Ginsberg et al. reported using Google search query volume
              to estimate influenza activity in advance of traditional
              methodologies. It was a groundbreaking example of digital disease
              detection, and it still remains illustrative of the power of
              gathering data from the internet for important research. In
              recent years, the methodologies have been extended to include new
              topics and data sources; Twitter in particular has been used for
              surveillance of influenza-like-illnesses, political sentiments,
              and even behavioral risk factors like sentiments about childhood
              vaccination programs. As the research landscape continuously
              changes, the protection of human subjects in online research
              needs to keep pace. Here we propose a number of guidelines for
              ensuring that the work done by digital researchers is supported
              by ethical-use principles. Our proposed guidelines include: 1)
              Study designs using Twitter-derived data should be transparent
              and readily available to the public. 2) The context in which a
              tweet is sent should be respected by researchers. 3) All data
              that could be used to identify tweet authors, including
              geolocations, should be secured. 4) No information collected from
              Twitter should be used to procure more data about tweet authors
              from other sources. 5) Study designs that require data collection
              from a few individuals rather than aggregate analysis require
              Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. 6) Researchers should
              adhere to a userâ€™s attempt to control his or her data by
              respecting privacy settings. As researchers, we believe that a
              discourse within the research community is needed to ensure
              protection of research subjects. These guidelines are offered to
              help start this discourse and to lay the foundations for the
              ethical use of Twitter data.",

              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",

              variables such as reciprocity, homophily, transitivity, etc. This
              review first treats models for single (cross-sectionally
              observed) networks and then for network dynamics. For single
              networks, the older literature concentrated on conditionally
              uniform models. Various types of latent space models have been
              developed: for discrete, general metric, ultrametric, Euclidean,
              and partially ordered spaces. Exponential random graph models
              were proposed long ago but now are applied more and more thanks
              to the non-Markovian social circuit specifications that were
              recently proposed. Modeling network dynamics is less complicated
              than modeling single network observations because dependencies
              are spread out in time. For modeling network dynamics,
              continuous-time models are more fruitful. Actor-oriented models
              here provide a model that can represent many dependencies in a
              flexible way. Strong model development is now going on to combine
              the features of these models and to extend them to more

  abstract = "The focus of this work is on developing probabilistic models for
              temporal activity of users in social networks (e.g., posting and
              tweeting) by incorporating the social network influence as
              perceived by the user. Although prior work in this area has
              developed sophisticated models for user activity, these models
              either ignore social network influence completely or incorporate
              it in an implicit manner. We overcome the nontransparency of the
              network in the model at the individual scale by proposing a
              coupled hidden Markov model (HMM), where each user's activity
              evolves according to a Markov chain with a hidden state that is
              influenced by the collective activity of the friends of the user.
              We develop generalized Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithms for
              parameter learning and state estimation for the proposed
              framework. We then validate the proposed model using a
              significant corpus of user activity on Twitter. Our numerical
              studies show that with sufficient observations to ensure accurate
              model learning, the proposed framework explains the observed data
              better than either a renewal process-based model or a
              conventional (uncoupled) HMM. We also demonstrate the utility of
              the proposed approach in predicting the time to the next tweet.
              Finally, clustering in the model parameter space is shown to
              result in distinct natural clusters of users characterized by the
              interaction dynamic between a user and his network.",

              volunteer developers as well as new and experienced users.
              Previous work has applied social network analysis (SNA) to open
              source communities and has demonstrated value in expertise
              discovery and triaging. One problem with applying SNA directly to
              the data of the entire project lifetime is that the impact of
              local activities will be drowned out. In this paper we provide a
              method for aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing local (small
              time periods) interactions of bug reporting participants by using
              the SNA to measure the betweeness centrality of these
              participants. In particular we mined the Android bug repository
              by producing social networks from overlapping 30-day windows of
              bug reports, each sliding over by day. In this paper we define
              three patterns of participant behaviour based on their local
              centrality. We propose a method of analyzing the centrality of
              bug report participants both locally and globally, then we
              conduct a thorough case study of the bug reporter's activity
              within the Android bug repository. Furthermore, we validate the
              conclusions of our method by mining the Android version control
              system and inspecting the Android release history. We found that
              windowed SNA analysis elicited local behaviour that were
              invisible during global analysis.",

  abstract  = "Effective crisis response requires rapid assessment of a
               situation in order to form actionable plans. Social media and
               traditional media are critical to this assessment. This paper
               describes a rapid ethnographic approach for extracting
               information from Twitter and news media and then assessing that
               information using dynamic network analysis techniques. Text
               mining high-dimensional network analytics and visualization are
               combined to provide an integrated approach to assessing large
               dynamic networks. This approach was used as the Benghazi
               consulate and the Egyptian embassy were attacked in 2012. This
               near-real-time assessment was set against a backdrop of ongoing
               data collection associated with the Arab Spring countries. This
               ongoing collection provided a baseline for Libya and Egypt
               against which the new data could be assessed. Herein, the
               outcome of that near-real-time assessment, the tools used, the
               lessons learned, and the results discovered are described. The
               same approach was used in other crisis events including
               SuperStorm Sandy, the Kenyan elections, from which examples are
               also drawn. We find that to be effective such analytics require
               the use of multiple media, deep dives into specific secondary
               issues, and a high-level assessment of not just who is doing
               what, but who is providing what information. Finally, we show
               the criticality of baseline data for interpreting the behavior
               during a crisis.",

              knowledge building as part of an international project. Through a
              longitudinal study and analysis of cumulative research data, we
              sought to answer the question, 'what happened and why in
              knowledge building?' Research data constitute messages which
              participants have written into a shared knowledge building
              database. A multi-method approach combing quantitative and
              qualitative data was adopted which integrated analysis of message
              generation, content analysis, network analysis, structure of
              message threads, discourse analysis and interviews. Conclusions
              are based on analysis of almost 2000 messages. Qualitative
              content analysis reveals 14 main categories of data. When the
              content of the messages are analysed, quantitatively cumulative
              trends emerge. When the frequencies of messages are plotted
              against time, peaks and troughs of message writing are revealed.
              The explanations for these patterns and variations are sought
              through interviews. Social network analysis shows that the
              network is centralised. The research literature suggests that
              decentralised networks are ideal, but in this particular case,
              the expert centralisation was beneficial for knowledge building
              in the collaborative and associated professional networks. The
              reasons for this are discussed.",

# Components and Cliques {#ch7}

Our goals for Week 7 include:

- Understanding components and cliques
- Becoming familiar with several popular approaches to identifying groups
- Using SNA software to identify components and detect cliques

**Important note**: Our first Zoom meeting is taking place on Monday, March 11, 5:30-7pm. Please check your email for the invitation. 

## Introduction to Components and Cliques

Please watch the following video before reading [Chapter 6](http://methods.sagepub.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n6.xml) of Carolan (2014). This video provides intuitions that could be useful before diving into mathematical representations.

## From Data to Analyses: A Demo

In the following video, I demonstrate a process of going from a secondary dataset towards some simple analyses covered in the past few weeks. This demo is especially useful if you are in `Track R`. But some principles, such as *tidy data* and *reproducible analysis*, should also apply for `Track Gephi`.

R code used in this demo can be found [here](https://github.com/meefen/sna-ed/blob/master/assets/lab_week7.R). Please feel free to reuse and extend. 

## Week 7 Activities

### Read, Annotate, and Share

- **Read** [Carolan (2014), ch. 6](http://methods.sagepub.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n6.xml)
- **Annotate** as we normally do using proper hashtags (e.g., `question`, `idea`) and doing our `ABCs` (i.e., "Ask a question", "Brag about your understanding", and "Connect another peerâ€™s ideas").
- **Share** tips and tricks related to component/clique analysis on Slack:
    - For Track R, post *Code Snippets* from your analysis on the `R` channel. You can post anything that others may find useful. For example, you can show off your code that detects `strong components` in a directed network.
    - For Track Gephi, post description, snapshots, or posts on the `Gephi` channel.
- (Optional) **Find** and **Share** an educational study that deals with network components or cliques. Point out specific techniques applied in that study.
- Don't forget to respond to each other's contributions!

### Project Checkpoint 2

In this week, there is a project checkpoint assignment designed to keep you "on track". The description of this checkpoint reads as following:

> Students will share their refined project ideas, with a concrete data collection plan fleshed out.

At this point, we have diverged tremendoulsy on the final projects! I understand that you are all at different stages of your projects. So I will **not** require formal submission of this assignment and instead encourage you to make an appointment with me to discuss your project if needed. 

Have a great week, and I look forward to seeing you in Zoom on March 11!

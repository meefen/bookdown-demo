# Network Dynamics and Temporality {#ch11}

> It's About Time!

So far in this class we've been mostly working with `static` networks or `snapshots` of dynamic networks. That's enough for most of our needs. However, social networks are dynamic in nature. One important use of SNA is to understand how an network would function given its current structure. Such a question is genuinely about network dynamics.

In Week 11, we will:

- Explore ways to conceptual time and temporality in SNA
- Learn how to construct temporal networks
- Learn approaches to visualizing and measuring temporal networks
- Explore potential application of temporal SNA to our projects

**Note**: You may see people using different words *temporal*, *dynamic*,  *longitudinal* interchangeably to describe social networks.

## Getting started with network dynamics

### Why temporality in networks matters?

Watch a [video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking/lecture/1qEBU/schellings-segregation-model) about the **Schelling's Segregation Model** to understand the importance of understanding network dynamics. 

To further explore the Schelling's Segregation Model:

1. Open http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/
2. Adjust Similarity threshold to 50% --> Record rounds
3. Adjust Similarity threshold to 75% --> Record rounds

### Conceptualize time in social networks

- Timestamp of an event
- Duration of an event
- Frequency of of events
- Time-order / contingency of events
- ...

### Approaches of considering time

- Accumulation of networks
- "Sliding window" (Gloor et al. 2004)
  - with hisotory
  - no history
- SNA measures adding 'a temporal taste'
  - time series
  - truely

### Tools for temporal network analysis

#### Gephi

**Gephi** supports the analysis of dynamic networks. This website, [Exploring Big Historical Data](http://www.themacroscope.org/2.0/dynamic-networks-in-gephi/), provides a useful introduction. See also the Youtube video below.

#### R

**R packages** `networkDynamic`, `tsna`, and `ndtv` are very useful for temporal network analysis and visualization.

Here is a [demo with R code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meefen/sna-ed/master/assets/temporal.html) (if you see random text, please save the file to your computer and open it again)

## Week 11 Activities and Upcoming Milestones

### Week 11 activities

Our textbook does not have a chapter on this topic, but you're encouraged to **explore** resources and examples of temporal SNA by yourself and **share back to our class via either Slack or Hypothesis**. 

Below are a few readings you can start with:

- @Gloor2004-vy
- @Jiang2013-ew
- @Myllari2010-ad
- @Rodriguez2014-kx
- @Raghavan2014-uc
- @Carley2014-xa

### Upcoming milestones

As we approach the final weeks of this semester, I want to remind you of two upcoming milestones:

- **5/6, Project presentations** -- I will send out more details.
- **5/13, Project final artifact + Reflection essay due** -- You can find some basic info on the syllabus. More detailed info will be shared in later weeks.

Have a wonderful week!

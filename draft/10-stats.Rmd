# Statistical Analysis with Network Data {#ch10}

In his book, John @Scott2012-fq commented on a struggle shared among many researchers -- including many of us -- who are attracted to SNA because of specific analytical needs but get turned away by SNA's mathematical and statistical complexity. The most central goal of this course is to address this challenge, by focusing on essential SNA concepts -- e.g., density, centrality, cliques, etc. -- instead of the nitty-gritty mathematical details involved in SNA, so that we feel confident in designing an SNA study and venturing into numerous directions made possible by SNA (and network analysis in general).

This week, we will stretch to statistical analysis *with* network data that may unleash the power of work you've been doing so far. In particular, we will work to:

- Understand differences between the mathematical and statistical approaches to SNA
- Become familiar with different kinds of statistical analysis with network data
- Plan on applying statistical modeling approaches to your SNA project (if possible)

## Introduction

The video at the bottom provides an introduction to this week. 

Before this video, I want to mention that *statistical models* and *modeling* will get mentioned quite frequently in this week's text. These terms are central to statistics in general. What **a model** does is to provide a statistical approximation of the 'reality' we are interested, so that by generating 'better' approximations we are essentially getting closer to truly understanding the 'reality'.[^1] I personally like a point made by [@Burnham2003-eo] that all models are essentially wrong:

> Fundamental to our paradigm is that none of the models considered as the basis for data analysis are the 'true model' that generates the biological data we observe... A model is a simplification or approximation of reality and hence will not reflect all of reality (p. 20)

[^1]: Note that the description of models introduced here may not fit the philosophical worldview you feel comfortable with or subscribe to. Refer back to Section \@ref{threelevels} for an earlier discussion we had about aligning methodology and philosophical viewpoints.

## Week 10 Activities

1. **Read** [Carolan (2014), ch. 8](http://methods.sagepub.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n8.xml) and [ch. 9, till the end of *Regression*](http://methods.sagepub.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/Book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n9.xml).  

2. **Annotate** as we normally do using proper hashtags (e.g., `question`, `idea`, `stats`) and doing our `ABCs` (i.e., "Ask a question", "Brag about your understanding", and "Connect another peerâ€™s ideas"). Because this week's topic is of great complexity, we're going to rely on our **collective wisdom** to develop deeper understanding. So please seek additional resources on your own, share back via Hypothes.is or Slack, and help out a colleague. 

3. **Share** on Slack a brief description about your use of statistical analysis in your project (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, regression, ERGMs). 
  - Many of you appreciated seeing each other's reports that include scripts and results. And I myself will also post a report to our community space (i.e. Slack) later this week. 
  - If you are using R, please check [last week's notes on using an R Notebook](https://bookdown.org/chen/snaEd/course-project-check-in.html#use-an-r-notebook) for report generation. 
  - If you are using Gephi, you do not have as many options as R provides. But you can export your network data populated with network measures to an external statistical software (e.g., SPSS) for additional analysis.

## Course Project Check-in

[This document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PRVF6FDAL9THCnKn2hVNkXuK8SFabT1i/view) provides a rubric you can follow while working on your course project. But please note each project is unique and let the community know if you are uncertain about any aspects of the rubric. 

<!-- Each component is of equal weight and needs to be addressed in your project artifact. -->

<!-- If you propose a different format -- such as an interactive SNA tool for a specific audience -- please get in touch with Bodong to discuss an adapted rubric that will **work for you**. -->

<!-- | Components                                                      | 4-Expert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 3 | 2 | 1-Novice                                                                                                                                                                         | -->

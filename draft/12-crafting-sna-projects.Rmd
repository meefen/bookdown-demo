# Planning SNA Research and Projects {#ch12}

As we are all deeply immersed in the course project, this week we will **be reflective and continue to refine our projects**. 

### Week 12 activities

1. **Read** [Carolan (2014), Chapter 12](http://methods.sagepub.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n12.xml). This chapter summarizes things we've already been discussing and doing in this class, and it could serve as a good resource for you to self-check your ongoing course project.

2. **Annotathon** on our Carolan textbook website using `Hypothesis`. Below are four prompts:

- When reading through the nine steps presented in this chapter, annotate areas where your project is currently falling a little short or will benefit more work from. 
- When reading through the nine steps, annotate things you will do differently from the author.
- When reading through the Software Sampler, annotate software packages you wish to try in the future and explain why. Please share useful resources you found to the class.
- On Research Ethics, share any thoughts you have about ethical considerations in SNA research and practice.

As always, please add our `SNAEd` tag, and other appropriate tags, to your Hypothesis annotations.

3. **Continue to refine your SNA projects**. If you have questions, please post them in the Slack `home` channel or directly PM Bodong.

### Upcoming milestones

As a reminder, we have two upcoming milestones:

- **5/6, Project presentations** -- I will send out more details.
- **5/13, Project final artifact + Reflection essay due** -- You can find some basic info on the syllabus. More detailed info will be shared in later weeks.

Have a wonderful week!

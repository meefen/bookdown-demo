# Applications and Examples II {#ch9}

In Week \@ref(ch3), we explored a range of example applications of SNA in education. The purpose of that exploration was to expose ourselves to the potential of SNA for educational research and to get acquainted with basic SNA terminologies that were later introduced in the course.

This week, after considerable work on several areas, we're going to do **a 'deep dive'** in more examples. This time, you are bringing with yourself a collection of SNA concepts and techniques. By critically examining examples closely, the goal of this week's exploration is to further:

- Understand how an SNA study could become theoretically and methodologically aligned
- Detect critical decisions of SNA research in action
- Understand how SNA techniques could be combined with other methods

## Week 9 Activities

- **Read, Examine & Share**, due by **Saturday March 30, 5PM**
- **Comment**, due by **Monday April 1, 5PM**

### Read, Examine & Share

**Choose**: A research article that is/seems highly relevant to your project idea (a list is offered below if you cannot identify one by yourself). Record its bibliographic information so that you can share with the class. Ideally this article could serve as a model text for your 'Project Final Artifact', especially if you plan to develop something publishable from this course.

**Examine** this article closely, focusing on the following areas: 1) research purposes served by SNA in the study; 2) specific SNA techniques applied; 3) how SNA is combined with other methodology.

**Share** your thoughts as a **Slack Post** on the `assignments` channel. In this post, add key take-aways from this article that may inform your own research project. This Slack post is due by **Saturday March 30, 5PM**.

### Comment

Spend time reading each others' posts. When you're reading, try your best to 'borrow' ideas from articles introduced by others to inform your own project. Make sure you credit a colleague's contribution to your thinking by **commenting** on her post. 

Please try to comment on at least 2 classmates' posts. Comments are due by **Monday March 27, 11:59PM**.

### Lists of articles to choose from

**Note: Ideally you will choose a reading by yourself that is pertinent to your project idea.**

## Notes on the Course Project

Based on our Slack communications (public or private), you are all making progress on your course projects. I want to make a few notes so that you can plan your project:

- The *Project Final Artifact* is worth 30 points. "Each student will develop a project final artifact that has key components of a research proposal (including research problem, literature review, research questions, methodology, anticipated findings, significance, etc.). Other innovative formats, such as an interactive social network dashboard, are encouraged and should be negotiated in advance with the instructor."  If you have ideas/concerns with your own project, please send Bodong a Direct Message.
- A rubric will be shared soon to guide your work on the Project Final Artifact. But do use this week's exploration as an opportunity to make an outline for your Final Artifact. As I've mentioned in earlier weeks, I'm looking for your capabilities in **making theoretically and methodologically informed decisions** in a research area you specialize. 


### Use an R Notebook

I mentioned this tip in an earlier video, and want to mention it again that if you're using `R/igraph` for your SNA project, please keep a file (or multiple files) containing your R scripts. You can directly compile a new report after adding new scripts to your growing project each week. You can reuse your scripts for a new dataset. You can ... I can go on for another 1,000 words, but the key idea is your project (containing your ideas, data, scripts) is fully recorded and reproducible. 

To learn more about R Notebooks, check out the video below. Note that you can (1) compile a report directly from a `.R` file, and (2) compile a report from a `.Rmd` (i.e., [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)) file.

Again, if you have specific questions, post them on the `home` channel or reach me via Slack PMs. 

Have a wonderful week!

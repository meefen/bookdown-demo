# Applications and Examples I {#ch3}

Thank you all for doing the **ABC**---Ask a question, Brag about your understanding, and Connect with a peer's idea---when annotating our readings!  Below is a visualization of our interactions on Hypothesis in the past two weeks. It is slightly more complex than the one from last week, as I used a node-level measure named *indegree* to scale the size of nodes.

In Week 2, I challenged our community with the following goals:

> 1) more colleagues will join the conversation, 2) there will be more back-and-forth dialogues (or increased reciprocity in SNA terms), and 3) we will have a denser network.

Based on what I see in this new network, I can claim with confidence we have more colleagues participating in our conversation on Hypothesis (from `7` to `10`) and higher reciprocity (from `0.18` to `0.3`). But because of the increase of participants, our network did not get denser (from `0.26` to `0.22`). So I would like to congratulate on our progress and encourage you to interact even more with different colleagues in our community!

Cannot wait to make such a graph on your own? We will start exploring SNA data and tools very soon. But I see our current exploration of theories, contexts, and research questions even more critical than manipulating tools because tools are the easy part!

**In this week, we will:**

- Examine some concrete examples of SNA research
- 'Present' an example of your choice to the class
- 'Take' ideas from each other to inform your project ideas

## Applications and Examples of SNA

After the first two weeks of exploration, I am quite sure we've come to a share recognition on **the potential of SNA** in various domains. In this page, I want to share two applications of SNA -- outside of education -- that I found inspiring.

The first example is **Suzanne Simard's TED talk on "How trees talk to each other"** that I stumbled upon when listening to NPR. (Canadian accent alert!) The reason I picked this exmaple is Simard's work demonstrates a *paradigm shift* (discussed by Barry Wellman in last week's readings) in the study of trees and forests by highlighting the importance of *ties* among trees.

The second example is Amar Dhand's work on "**stroke patients' health behaviors**" that is based on a specific type of social network named *ego-networks*. The reason I picked this example is Dhand did a great job presenting the motivation of their work and went on to investigate a solution powered by SNA. This presentation could be a great model for you to follow for this week's class activity (see next page for details).

Did you find these examples inspiring? Feel free to share on the Slack `ideas` channel, or make Hypo annotations on this page using hashtags `SNAEd` & `ideas`.

## Week 3 Activities

- **Read & Share**, due by **Friday Feb 8, 11:59PM**
- **Take / comment**, due by **Monday Feb 11, 11:59PM**

### Readings

1) **Skim** [Carolan, ch. 10, on "Social Capital"](http://methods.sagepub.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n10.xml), and annotate concepts you recognize / don't know

2) **Closely examine** an empirical study of your choice. You could either (a) **claim** one article from below -- by annotating it using Hypo, or (b) **search** for one article from your research area.  I would recommend option #b so that this reading activity is adding to your project.

When examining the article, please try to discern those three levels of considerations I presented in Week 2 (i.e., Philosophical, Methodological, and methods).

### Share & Take

1) **Share** the article you read in a concise manner to the class. The video on "stroke patients" in the previous page could be a great example to follow. In your sharing, you should cover:

- research problem and questions
- collection of SNA data
- specific use of SNA (e.g., specific SNA measures, visualizations)
- key findings
- one "praise" and/or one "push"

You can choose between these **two formats**:

- *a screencast* (5-min max): A video presentation of you talking through your example. Post a link to your video to the Slack `assignments` channel. Potential video capturing tools include Jing, QuickTime, and Screencast-O-Matic.
- *a Slack post* (500-word max): Post a text-based post to the Slack `assignments` channel as we did in Week 2. 

2) **Take** ideas from each other's presentations to inform your project. **Comment** on each other's posts to acknowledge ideas you take from them, seek clarifications, etc. Continue to craft your project ideas. 

Have a wonderful week!
